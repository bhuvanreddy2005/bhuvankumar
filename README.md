## üåê Deployment Guide

### Deploy Backend (Node.js/Express) on Render
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. [Create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and get your connection string.
3. [Sign up at Render.com](https://render.com/).
4. Create a new **Web Service**:
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Root directory: `/server`
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Start command: `npm start`
   - Add environment variables:
     - `MONGODB_URI` = your MongoDB Atlas connection string
     - `JWT_SECRET` = your secret
     - `CLIENT_URL` = (your frontend URL, after deploying frontend)
5. Deploy and get your backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com`)

### Deploy Frontend (React) on Vercel
1. Push your frontend code to GitHub (ensure `/client` is the root for frontend).
2. [Sign up at Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
3. Import your GitHub repo:
   - Root directory: `/client`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `build`
   - Add environment variable:
     - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = your Render backend URL
4. Deploy and get your frontend URL (e.g., `https://your-frontend.vercel.app`)

### Update CORS and Environment Variables
- Make sure your backend's `CLIENT_URL` matches your Vercel frontend URL.
- Make sure your frontend's `REACT_APP_API_URL` matches your Render backend URL.
